# Review Notes: Overall the website and its responsiveness is very good the only issue I had with the desktop version is the space underneath on the home page under the block of text, I recommend either adding an additional photo or up the font-size if possible. On tablet the resolution on the photos is not good for the screen if possible maybe get another image or scale it down if possible so its not so grainy. Same with the logos as well on the equipment page they are very grainy seems to only be a big issue on the tablet version when I saw and I know that is not required for the assignment but something to look into improving for the future. One thing that is just a personal suggestion not something that needs to be changed but looking into making the phone numbers something a mobile user can click to access the phone number without leaving the site allowing more constant traffic on site. The footer on mobile i say reduce the margins on the side so it fills more of the screen the empty space on the side takes away from the site in my personal opinion. The alignment on the service page is a bit off adjusting it to where it is even like the top half of the text box would be a good change to make.Personal feeling, not the biggest fan of the blue background on the carousel arrows.
